/**
 * The `loadInstrumentationModule` method (source: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/5b7833e3/packages/next/src/server/next-server.ts#L301)
 * calls `module.findSourceMap` (https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#modulefindsourcemappath) which we haven't implemented causing a runtime error.
 *
 * To solve this issue this function gets all the `loadInstrumentationModule` declarations found in the file and removes all the statements
 * from their bodies (making them no-op methods).
 *
 * Instrumentation is a Next.js feature for monitoring and logging (see: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation),
 * the removal of this method's logic most likely breaks this feature (see: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation),
 * so this function is likely temporary and something that we'll have to fix in the future.
 *
 * TODO: investigate and re-enable instrumentation (https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues/171)
