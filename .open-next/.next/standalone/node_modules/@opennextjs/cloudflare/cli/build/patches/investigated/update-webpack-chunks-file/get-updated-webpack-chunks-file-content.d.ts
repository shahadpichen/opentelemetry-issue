/**
 * Updates the content of the webpack runtime file in a manner so that it doesn't perform runtime dynamic `require` calls which fail in our runtime.
 *
 * It does so by appropriately updating a function that in the unminified webpack runtime file appears as `__webpack_require__.f.require` which is
 * the one that normally would cause dynamic requires to happen at runtime.
 *
 * `__webpack_require__.f.require` example: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/dae16ad11e/examples/module-worker/README.md?plain=1#L284-L304

 *
 * @param fileContent the content of the webpack runtime file
 * @param chunks the identifiers of the chunks (found on the filesystem)
 * @returns the content of the webpack runtime file updated with our custom logic
