/**
 * Updates the function that in the unminified webpack runtime file appears as `__webpack_require__.f.require` which is a function that
 * installs chunks by importing/requiring them at runtime.
 *
 * `__webpack_require__.f.require` example: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/dae16ad11e/examples/module-worker/README.md?plain=1#L284-L304
 *
 * This function needs to be updated so that it requires chunks using the standard `require` function and not webpack's custom `require` logic
 * which fails in the workerd runtime.
 *
 * @param sourceFile the webpack runtime file parsed with ts-morph (note: this gets side-effectfully updated)
 * @param chunkInstallationIdentifiers the names of the `installedChunks` and `installChunk` variables
 * @param chunks the identifiers of the chunks (found on the filesystem)
 * @returns the content of the sourceFile but with the require function updated
